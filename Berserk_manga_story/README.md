# RAG Chatbot for Healthcare Research

## Project Overview

This project is a foundational implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot, intended to support upcoming research in the healthcare sector. The RAG chatbot combines information retrieval with generative AI, allowing for the dynamic generation of responses based on a mixture of predefined knowledge and real-time information. This version focuses on establishing the base functionality, which will be expanded and refined as part of a research paper.

## Features
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: Combines retrieval-based techniques with generative models to provide accurate, informative, and context-aware responses.
- **Manga story focused**: Although still in its early stages, the chatbot is built with healthcare applications in mind, ensuring scalability and adaptability for future healthcare-specific datasets. This project knowledge was based on the popular manga Berserk.
- **Extensible Architecture**: The architecture has been designed to easily accommodate new datasets, additional retrieval mechanisms, and improvements to the language model.

## Future Scope
- **Healthcare Research Integration**: This chatbot will be integrated into a research paper focused on improving conversational AI for healthcare, with an emphasis on providing accurate, staff-friendly information.
- **Domain-Specific Data**: Future iterations will include domain-specific datasets to enhance the quality and relevance of responses in healthcare contexts.
